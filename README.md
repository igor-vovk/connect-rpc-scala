# Connect-RPC â†” ScalaPB GRPC Bridge

This library provides a bridge between [Connect-RPC](https://connectrpc.com/docs/protocol) protocol and
[ScalaPB](https://scalapb.github.io) GRPC compiler for Scala.
It is inspired and takes ideas from [grpc-json-bridge](https://github.com/avast/grpc-json-bridge) library, which don't
seem to be supported anymore + the library doesn't follows a Connect-RPC standard (while being very close to it),
which makes using clients generated with ConnectRPC not possible.

At the moment, only unary (non-streaming) methods are supported.

Library focuses on Scala 3.x support from the beginning.

## Usage

TODO: Add usage instructions

## Future improvements

* Support GET-requests
* Support non-unary methods
